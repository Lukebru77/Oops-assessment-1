1.	List three major version control software for software engineering. \
•	Git \
•	Subversion \
•	Mercurial 
2.	What are the main advantages to using Git in your software development, and how is it useful for game developers. \
•	Branching model \
•	Encourages collaboration
3.	Define the following terms in relation to Git. Branch, Pull, Push, repository, working copy, merge \
•	Branch: A pointer to a snapshot of your changes. A lightweight movable pointer of one of these commits. \
•	Pull: To fetch and download content from a remote repository to match that content. \
•	Push: To upload a local repository content to a remote repository \
•	Repository: To save multiple versions of your code, that you can access when needed. \
•	Working Copy: Copies a Git repository which can be edited with Textastic. \
•	Git Merge: Merge two branches together.
4.	If you are working at a company, which of their policies and procedures might relate to using version control systems such as Git. \
•	Compliance with Laws and Regulations \
•	User Safety \
•	Intellectual Property, Authenticity, and Private Information \
•	Spam and Inauthentic Activity on GitHub \
•	Site Access and Safety \
•	Services Usage Limits \
•	Information Usage Restrictions \
•	Privacy \
•	Excessive Bandwidth Use \
•	Advertising on GitHub \
•	User Protection
5.	Merge conflicts can occur while using git. List merge tools or diff tools you can use to help you merge and deal with conflicts. \
•	Beyond Compare: It's a cross-platform propietary data comparison utility that can compare files and multiple types of directories. \
•	P4Merge: It's a diff and merge tool that's used for visualizing differences between files, branches, and repositories. \
•	Git log command: It helps making lists of commits that's causing the conflict.
6.	In a merged source code file, how does Git let you know there is a conflict? \
•	The Status Command: Produces a log with a list of commits that conflict between the merging branches when you pass the merge argument to the git log command. 
7.	What are the steps you can take to resolve Git conflicts? \
•	Step 1: Open the conflicted file and make any necessary changes. \
•	Step 2: Use the git add command to stage the new merged content. \
•	Step 3: Create a new commit with the help of the git commit command.
8.	What does git revert do, and how can you use it? \
•	A forward-moving undo operation that offers a safer method to undo changes. \
•	It’s used for undoing changes to a repository's commit history.
9.	What does git reset do, and how can you use it? \
•	It moves both the HEAD and branch refs to the specified commit. \
•	It’s used to undo changes in the working directory and get back to a specific commit while discarding all the commits made after that one.
10.	What is the difference between git revert and git reset? \
•	Git revert: It’s used for undoing changes that have been committed. \
•	Git reset: Is for undoing changes that haven't been committed yet.
11.	True or False: It is okay to commit broken code to the main branch. \
•	False: You should never commit code that doesn't pass tests.
12.	True or False: You should commit related changes. For example, fixing two different bugs should produce two separate commits. \
•	True: A commit should be a wrapper for related changes.
13.	Describe what is DevOps, how is it useful for game developers? \
•	It’s the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity. \
•	It enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments.
14.	List what tools can be used with DevOps. Give a brief description of each one. (at least 3) \
•	Jenkins:  It’s an open-source continuous integration (CI) server. \
•	Docker: It can allow you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. \
•	Kubernetes:  It’s an automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
15.	What is CI/CD and how can it be used to automate the game development process? \
•	Continuous Integration (CI): It’s the practice of automating the integration of code changing from multiple contributors into a single software project. \
•	Continuous Delivery (CD): It’s a software development practice that uses automation to speed the release of new code.
