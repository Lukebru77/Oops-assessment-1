1.	List three major version control software for software engineering. \
•	Git \
•	Subversion \
•	Mercurial 
2.	What are the main advantages to using Git in your software development, and how is it useful for game developers. \
•	Branching model \
•	Encourages collaboration
3.	Define the following terms in relation to Git. Branch, Pull, Push, repository, working copy, merge \
•	Branch: A pointer to a snapshot of your changes. A lightweight movable pointer of one of these commits. \
•	Pull: To fetch and download content from a remote repository to match that content. \
•	Push: To upload a local repository content to a remote repository \
•	Repository: To save multiple versions of your code, that you can access when needed. \
•	Working Copy: Copies a Git repository which can be edited with Textastic. \
•	Git Merge: Merge two branches together.
4.	If you are working at a company, which of their policies and procedures might relate to using version control systems such as Git. \
•	Compliance with Laws and Regulations \
•	User Safety \
•	Intellectual Property, Authenticity, and Private Information \
•	Spam and Inauthentic Activity on GitHub \
•	Site Access and Safety \
•	Services Usage Limits \
•	Information Usage Restrictions \
•	Privacy \
•	Excessive Bandwidth Use \
•	Advertising on GitHub \
•	User Protection
5.	Merge conflicts can occur while using git. List merge tools or diff tools you can use to help you merge and deal with conflicts. \
•	Simultaneous Edits: Two developers modify the same line of code in different branches. \
•	Conflicting Changes: A file is deleted in one branch and modified in another. \
•	Complex Merges: When multiple branches are being merged, with changes scattered across various files and lines.
6.	In a merged source code file, how does Git let you know there is a conflict? \
•	Viewing a list of the files with conflicting changes above the Merge pull request button. 
7.	What are the steps you can take to resolve Git conflicts? \
•	Under your repository name, click Pull requests. \
•	In the "Pull Requests" list, click the pull request with a merge conflict that you'd like to resolve. \
•	Near the bottom of your pull request, click Resolve conflicts. 
8.	What does git revert do, and how can you use it? \
•	A forward-moving undo operation that offers a safer method to undo changes. \
•	It’s used for undoing changes to a repository's commit history.
9.	What does git reset do, and how can you use it? \
•	It moves both the HEAD and branch refs to the specified commit. \
•	It’s used to undo changes in the working directory and get back to a specific commit while discarding all the commits made after that one.
10.	What is the difference between git revert and git reset? \
•	Git revert: it’s used as a tool for undoing committed changes. \
•	Git reset: is for undoing uncommitted changes.
11.	True or False: It is okay to commit broken code to the main branch. \
•	False: You should never commit code that doesn't pass tests.
12.	True or False: You should commit related changes. For example, fixing two different bugs should produce two separate commits. \
•	True: A commit should be a wrapper for related changes.
13.	Describe what is DevOps, how is it useful for game developers? \
•	It’s the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity. \
•	It enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments.
14.	List what tools can be used with DevOps. Give a brief description of each one. (at least 3) \
•	Jenkins:  It’s an open-source continuous integration (CI) server. \
•	Docker: It can allow you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. \
•	Kubernetes:  It’s an automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
15.	What is CI/CD and how can it be used to automate the game development process? \
•	Continuous Integration (CI): It’s the practice of automating the integration of code changing from multiple contributors into a single software project. \
•	Continuous Delivery (CD): It’s a software development practice that uses automation to speed the release of new code.
